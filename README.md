# MDA_Speeches
Repository for files pertaining to the speeches exam project of the MDA subject. Python version and used packages can be found in requirements.txt. You can install them all in one fell swoop in your environment using "pip install -r requirements.txt". Current version includes NLTK, textblob, spacy, stanza, beatifulsoup and GenSim. Would not recommend using textblob.
# Please create your own branch when making changes to the project and confirm with the group before merging!
